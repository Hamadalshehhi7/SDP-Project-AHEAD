# ✚ AHEAD — Advanced Health Early Awareness and Disease Detection System

**Senior Design Project** · Python · Streamlit · scikit-learn · XGBoost · Plotly · Gemini

AHEAD is an educational early-awareness screening platform. A user (or a clinician) enters
lifestyle, medical-history and clinical values and receives a machine-learning screening
estimate for **diabetes**, **cardiovascular disease** or **chronic kidney disease** — together
with a gauge, next steps, the factors AHEAD noticed in the inputs and an optional AI-generated
explanation.

> AHEAD does not diagnose disease and must not be used to start, stop or change treatment.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Python 3.11 is recommended.

Set `AHEAD_DB_PATH` to a protected durable volume to retain accounts and doctor review records across app restarts. By default the SQLite database is `ahead.sqlite3` in the project folder. Streamlit Cloud's local files may be lost on restart; use a persistent volume or a database service before relying on saved records. Keep the database private and use fictional or de-identified patient data for demonstrations.

---

## Running the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the printed URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`). Create a patient account on the sign-in page. To provision the first doctor account, set `AHEAD_DOCTOR_EMAIL` and a strong `AHEAD_DOCTOR_PASSWORD` (12+ characters) before the first run.

---

## Demo accounts

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Patient | `user@ahead.demo` | `user123` |
| Doctor / Admin | `doctor@ahead.demo` | `doctor123` |

Demo accounts are disabled by default. Set `AHEAD_ENABLE_DEMO_ACCOUNTS=1` **only** for a classroom demo; never upload identifiable patient records when demo credentials are enabled. Accounts use salted password hashes and are stored in the local SQLite database. Doctor accounts see the Clinical Dashboard and records are scoped to their own account. This is a research prototype, not a production authentication or health-record system.

Clinical uploads require model feature columns except age. An optional `DOB`, `DateOfBirth`, `date_of_birth`, or `Date of Birth` column (YYYY-MM-DD) fills age or the heart model's age category. Missing and invalid values appear per row and are not scored until corrected. Correct a row and save it in the review queue, then score eligible records. Clinicians can mark a record reviewed or excluded and add a note. The file is limited to 5,000 rows and 15 MB. The PDF and CSV contain entered data; handle downloads appropriately.

Arabic currently covers navigation, key patient-screening controls, several input labels and the result summary. Long-form guidance, doctor tools and the generated PDF remain English; full translation and right-to-left layout are future work. No email, text or push notifications are sent. The map-search link does not show live appointment availability.

## AI features (Gemini)

AHEAD Insight (personalised result explanation) and the AI Assistant use Google Gemini
through the `google-genai` SDK. Provide an API key in **either** place:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"          # environment variable
```

or in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (git-ignored):

```toml
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-key"
```

Without a key the app still works: Insight shows a notice and the Assistant answers the
suggested questions from built-in text. The model name lives in `ahead/config.py`
(`GEMINI_MODEL`).

---

## Datasets

| Condition | File | Records | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Diabetes | `data/diabetes.csv` | 100,000 | `diabetes` |
| Cardiovascular | `data/heart.csv` | 246,022 | `HadHeartAttack` |
| Chronic kidney disease | `data/kidney_disease.csv` | 1,659 | `Diagnosis` |

Two of the datasets are strongly imbalanced (8.5 % positive for diabetes, 5.5 % for heart,
92 % positive for kidney), which is why the app reports disease recall, F1/F2 and ROC-AUC
alongside accuracy.

---

## Re-training the models

The trained pipelines are included. To rebuild everything:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

For each disease the script:

1. splits the data 64 % train / 16 % validation / 20 % test (stratified),
2. trains Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Decision Tree and XGBoost
   inside a `Pipeline(preprocessor → classifier)`,
3. saves every pipeline to `models/all_models/` so the app can compare them,
4. picks the winner on the validation set (macro-F1 for diabetes/kidney, F2 for heart),
5. tunes the heart model's probability threshold on the validation set,
6. reports final metrics once on the untouched test set and writes `models/model_meta.json`.

---

## How the machine learning works

* **Preprocessing** — numeric columns are median-imputed and standardised; categorical columns
  are most-frequent-imputed and one-hot encoded (`ColumnTransformer`).
* **Prediction** — `predict_proba()` gives the probability of the disease class; the result is
  "elevated" when it reaches the model's decision threshold (0.5, or the tuned value for the
  recommended heart model).
* **Interpretation** — tree models expose `feature_importances_`, Logistic Regression uses
  absolute coefficient magnitude; RBF-SVM has no per-feature importance.
* **Rule-based factors** — independent of the model, the app highlights entered values that are
  commonly discussed with a clinician (e.g. HbA1c ≥ 5.7 %, BMI ≥ 30, eGFR < 60).

## Deploying on Streamlit Cloud

1. Push the repository to GitHub — `app.py`, the whole `ahead/` package, `assets/`, `static/`,
   `models/` and `data/` must all be committed (note: `data/heart.csv` is 82 MB, above GitHub's
   50 MB warning threshold; consider Git LFS).
2. On [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) create a new app pointing at `app.py`.
3. Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` under *Advanced settings → Secrets* if you want the AI features.

## Common errors

| Error | Fix |
|---|---|
| "No trained model is available" | Run `python train_model.py` to create `models/` |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Activate the virtual environment and `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| A selected model says "has not been saved yet" | Run `python train_model.py` to generate `models/all_models/` |
| AI Assistant / Insight unavailable | Provide `GEMINI_API_KEY` (see above) |
| Background images missing | `server.enableStaticServing = true` must stay in `.streamlit/config.toml` and the PNGs in `static/` |
| Signed out after refreshing the page | Expected: the prototype keeps the session in memory only (no cookies) |
| Blank page after editing | Hard-refresh the browser (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R`) |
